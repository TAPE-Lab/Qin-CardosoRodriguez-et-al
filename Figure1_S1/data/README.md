# FOR INTERNAL USE

Renamed data files:

* dsub_Fig1_INT.rds: Local donwsampled version of the seurat integrated object from the PHATE plots in figure 1B. Full version will be available upon request.
This file has been renamed to downsampled_INTepifibmac.rds, and so has been the full version in the On Request directory.

* dsub_Fig2_INTepi.rds: Local downsampled version of the INTepi.rds object in the Zenodo repo. Renamed to downsampled_INTepi.rds.

* d_Fig2_INTepi_meta/phate.csv: Files renamed to meta_INTepi.csv and phate_INTepi.csv.

* DATA_pDApair_DotPlot.csv: Renamed to DA_resultsOverview.csv

* dares_geno/stroma.csv: Results for the milo objects in Zenodo (DA_INTepi_fib/geno.rds). Rename to DA_resultsFib/Geno.csv

**TODO**: 
Add donwsampled versions of the integrated objects currently only available upon request. Their original names were d_FigS1_INTfib/mac.rds.
Rename to DE_INTfib.rds and DE_INTmac.rds.
